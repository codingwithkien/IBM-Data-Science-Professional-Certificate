# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

## üìÑ Summary 
Working knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a must for data professionals like Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Data Engineers. Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL is a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases.  

In this course you will learn SQL inside out- from the very basics of Select statements to advanced concepts like JOINs.  

You will:  
-write foundational SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
-filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses 
-differentiate between DML & DDL  
-CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables 
-use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions 
-build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables  
-access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python 
-work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs 

Through hands-on labs and projects, you will practice building SQL queries, work with real databases on the Cloud, and use real data science tools. In the final project you‚Äôll analyze multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate your skills.

## üìë Main Topics 
- Analyze data within a database using SQL and Python.
- Create a relational database on Cloud and work with tables.
- Write SQL statements including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- Build more powerful queries with advanced SQL techniques like views, transactions, stored procedures and joins.
